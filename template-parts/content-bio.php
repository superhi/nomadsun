  <p>Not so long ago I thought people who took pictures all the time were not living in the moment, that they were missing something.</p>

  <p>I've come to believe photos can hold a special kind of meaning, that they are more than the sum of their parts, that a good photo holds more than just pixels.</p>

  <p>I read somewhere the value of a photograph grows with it's age. Here's to investing in photographs so I'll be rich in memories later.</p>
